Everything that follows grows from this.<br><em>The rule I set for myself: every version must be a single HTML file, no dependencies, no build step. This constraint shaped everything.</em></p>

                <p>A thin progress bar tracks completion percentage, turning green at 100%. When all tasks are done, a canvas overlay launches 120 confetti particles with gravity, spin, and color variety via requestAnimationFrame.

                <p>Every action gets a synthesized sound: add (ascending tone), complete (satisfying chord), delete (descending), priority (blip), navigate (tick), all-done (fanfare). Built entirely from oscillators with ADSR envelopes using Web Audio API. Toggle with the music note button. The app finds its voice.<br><em>Web Audio API was the gateway.

                <p>Each task tracks its creation timestamp. Over hours and days, tasks visually age: fresh (&lt;24h), day-old (1-3d), old (3-7d), ancient (7d+). Older tasks darken, show age badges, and ancient tasks tremble with a CSS keyframe animation. The app refreshes every 60 seconds. Time enters the picture.<br><em>The first philosophical question: "what if tasks had a lifespan?" Once the app understood time, it understood urgency.

                <p>Complete every task and 1.5 seconds later, a canvas breakout game appears. Your completed task texts become the bricks, colored by priority.

            <div class="version-detail">
                <p>Italic comments appear below tasks, pattern-matched to content categories: chores, email, exercise, meetings, shopping. Old tasks get increasingly passive-aggressive remarks ("I'm still here..." → "I'm basically furniture now"). A commentSeed ensures deterministic selection across re-renders. The app has opinions.<br><em>"What if the app had feelings about your procrastination?"

                <p>Deleted tasks don't truly vanish. They're stored in a separate localStorage key and rendered at the bottom of the list at 15% opacity with a floating CSS animation. They auto-expire after 24 hours. Press <kbd>G</kbd> to purge all ghosts with a synthesized sawtooth-noise sweep. Deletion has consequences.<br><em>The 24-hour auto-expiry was important.

                <p>Press <kbd>Z</kbd> to enter zen mode. The entire UI dissolves to show a single active task, centered, at 1.8rem.

A luminous organic structure &mdash; bioluminescent coral, neural networks, mycelium &mdash; grows from a seed point at the center. Growth happens based on real time away: short absences add fine detail, long ones spawn wild new branches. Each visit is a visible ring, like a tree. Colors evolve from deep blue (oldest) to warm gold (newest). Mouse proximity makes tendrils glow; clicks plant new growth points. Ambient generative sound deepens with complexity. You arrive and watch your absence become art.</p>

            <div class="version-detail">
                <p>Raindrops on a windowpane. Behind the glass: warm bokeh circles &mdash; distant city lights, blurred and glowing. Drops spawn at the top and run down with surface-tension physics: clinging, jittering, accelerating, pausing. When two drops meet, the smaller merges into the larger, which speeds up. Each drop is a tiny lens refracting the lights behind it. Wet trails mark where they've been. Static condensation clings to the glass. Drag your finger across to clear a trail through the fog (it re-condenses slowly). Rain cycles between drizzle and downpour over 2 minutes. Filtered white noise for rain, sub-bass rumble for distant thunder. Click to place a large drop. Press R to cycle intensity. Cozy. Melancholic. Warm inside.<br><em>This one needed no cleverness. No metaphor, no subversion. Just rain on glass. Sometimes the simplest idea is the most atmospheric. My #6 favorite.</em></p>

                <p>A pale cream table with wood grain. Each task is a square of washi paper &mdash; red, dusty blue, sage green, plum, gold, coral, indigo, peach. The task text is printed on the paper. Incomplete squares sit in a loose grid on the left, each with subtle crease marks and a faint shadow. Double-click to complete: the paper lifts, and over 2.4 seconds, folds itself through six steps into an origami figure &mdash; a crane, a boat, a lotus flower, a butterfly, a frog, a star, a fish, or a heart. Each fold plays a crisp paper sound. The finished figure bounces gently onto the right side, joining your collection. Completed cranes breathe &mdash; their wings shift with a barely perceptible rhythm. Right-click to delete: the paper crumples into a ball and rolls away. Figures can be dragged to rearrange. "N paper squares &middot; M figures folded." Flat becomes dimensional. Task becomes art. A quiet afternoon with beautiful paper.<br><em>The 6-step folding animation &mdash; watching a flat square transform into a crane over 2.4 seconds &mdash; is the best completion animation in the project.

Your cursor IS a flickering torch: a warm 200px circle of light that trembles with noise, ember particles drifting up. Everything outside the light is near-black. Paintings hide in the darkness, visible only when the torch passes near. Click the illuminated wall to add a task: type in rough pigment text, press Enter, and the words transform into a cave painting over 2 seconds. Fifteen types in the style of Lascaux: bison, horse, deer, mammoth, aurochs, positive and negative handprints, hunters with spears, star clusters, crescent moons, spirals. Rendered in red ochre, yellow ochre, charcoal, white chalk, brown earth. Double-click to complete: a red handprint stamps beside the painting. The cave extends 3&times; the screen &mdash; drag to pan, discovering your own work and eight ancient handprints that were already there. Tally marks count in groups of five. Deep reverberant drone. Drip echoes. You are 30,000 years in the past.<br><em>Cursor-as-torch was the breakthrough. Darkness as default, light as interaction. You can only see what you illuminate.

Double-click: the ship turns toward harbor and sails in over 5 seconds, its light brightening, docking at the base of the cliff among a growing row of warm safe lights.

Storms darken the sky, intensify the rain, and trigger lightning &mdash; a white screen flash followed by delayed bass thunder. Fog creeps in as a distance-based overlay, thickening around the player, thinning near. The full Web Audio system arrives: filtered white noise for ocean surf with an LFO-modulated lowpass, bandpass wind that swells with weather intensity, highpass rain that fades in during storms, synthesized thunder rumbles, and granular footstep crunch on every 15th step.

After rain, mushrooms sprout near tree roots: brown, red, white caps that glow faintly bioluminescent at night, then fade if the skies stay clear. A seasonal system reads the real calendar month: spring brings bright greens and blooming flowers, summer is vivid and full, autumn turns the deciduous trees amber and gold with falling leaf particles, winter strips them bare and dusts the pines with snow. New audio: rustling leaves scale with wind and tree density, bird chirps in spring and summer mornings. The flora is depth-sorted &mdash; the player walks among the trees, behind and between them.

Rabbits sit in the grass, ears twitching, hopping between patches of clover &mdash; then bolting when you get close. Silver fish school in the shallows, darting together, breaking and reforming, leaving tiny ripple circles. At dusk, fireflies emerge: yellow-green points pulsing on independent blink cycles, drifting toward you if you stand still, scattering if you move. Red-orange crabs scuttle sideways on the beach, pausing to dig, fleeing at your approach. Every animal has a state machine: idle, moving, fleeing. Every one respects terrain boundaries. New ambient sounds: crickets chirping at night in summer, frog croaks near water at dusk, seagull cries during the day. All fauna depth-sorted with the flora. The island is no longer empty.

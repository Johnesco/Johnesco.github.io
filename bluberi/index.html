        <strong>They already like you.</strong><br>
        The phone screen went well. They want someone to introduce QA to their process.<br>
        That is literally what you do. You have done it 5+ times.
    </div>
    
    <div class="mindset-box">
        <h3>Remember Who You Are</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>18 years of QA experience</strong> — you are not hoping to learn, you are bringing expertise</li>
            <li><strong>Built QA from scratch 5 times</strong> — DocbookMD, YouScience, CSD, EverlyWell, Apptronik</li>
            <li><strong>Gaming is where you started</strong> — Aspyr, Linden Lab, Blizzard, Heatwave</li>

        <p>They told you: <strong>"They want someone to come in and introduce QA to the process."</strong></p>
        <p>This is your superpower. You do not just test — you build the foundations that make software shippable. You introduce version control discipline, release candidate processes, and documentation standards to teams shipping without structure.</p>

    <h2>🎯 Your Value Proposition (Say This)</h2>
    
    <div class="highlight-box">
        <p style="font-size: 1.1em; margin: 0;">"I specialize in building QA foundations from scratch. I have done this five times in my career — at startups, healthcare companies, and most recently at a robotics company. I introduce the processes, documentation, and quality gates that help teams ship with confidence instead of crossing their fingers. Gaming is where I started, and I am excited to bring that experience back to the industry."</p>

        <div class="their-value">"Find It, Fix It, Own It"</div>
        <div class="your-proof">At Apptronik, I authored SOPs that did not exist. At CSD, I built the first QA function ever. I do not wait to be told — I see gaps and fill them.</div>

        <div class="their-value">"We Are the New School"</div>

    <div class="value-match">
        <div class="their-value">"It's A Team Sport"</div>
        <div class="your-proof">I am embedded QA, not siloed. I work alongside developers, not against them. At Apptronik, I bridged operations and engineering. At Blizzard, I connected player feedback to development.</div>

        <div class="their-value">"Standard Operating Success"</div>

        <div class="why">They want the highlight reel, not your life story. 2-3 minutes max.</div>
        <div class="answer">
            "I started in gaming QA — Aspyr, Linden Lab, Blizzard, Heatwave. That foundation taught me how to find bugs, work with developers, and understand what players care about. Over 18 years, I have specialized in building QA from scratch at companies that needed structure. Most recently at a robotics startup, I wrote the SOPs that did not exist and reduced testing setup time by 75%. I am excited about Bluberi because gaming is where I started, and introducing QA to the Jackalope studio is exactly the kind of work I do best."
        </div>
        <div class="key-point">Keep it tight. End with why Bluberi.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="question-card">
        <div class="question">"How would you approach introducing QA to a team that doesn't have formal processes?"</div>
        <div class="why">This is THE question. They told you this is what they need.</div>
        <div class="answer">
            "First, I listen and observe. I learn how the team currently works, what their pain points are, where defects slip through. I do not come in with a rigid playbook — I adapt to the team's culture and workflow.<br><br>
            Then I start small. Maybe it is a simple checklist for build validation, or a template for bug reports that actually helps developers fix issues faster. Quick wins build trust.<br><br>
            From there, I layer in more structure — test plans tied to milestones, requirements traceability, release criteria that everyone agrees on. The goal is not process for process sake. It is giving the team confidence that what they ship is ready."
        </div>
        <div class="key-point">Show you are collaborative, not prescriptive. You adapt to them.</div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="question-card">
        <div class="question">"Tell me about a time you built QA processes from scratch."</div>
        <div class="why">They want a specific story. Pick one and tell it well.</div>
        <div class="answer">
            <strong>Use: DocbookMD (HIPAA healthcare app)</strong><br><br>
            "When I joined DocbookMD, there was no QA. The founders were shipping a HIPAA-compliant messaging app without formal testing. I started by understanding the regulatory requirements — what had to be tested for compliance. Then I created our first test plans, defined what a release-ready build looked like, and established defect tracking. I grew the department from just me to a full team, hiring and mentoring new analysts. By the time I left, we had repeatable processes that ensured every release met HIPAA standards."
        </div>
        <div class="key-point">Situation → Action → Result. Keep it concrete.</div>

    <div class="question-card">
        <div class="question">"What experience do you have with hardware testing?"</div>
        <div class="why">The role involves physical slot cabinets.</div>
        <div class="answer">
            "At Apptronik, I tested humanoid robots — physical hardware in a lab environment. I wrote the startup, shutdown, and emergency procedures. I configured test stations and reduced setup time by 75% by standardizing the process. Earlier in my career, at Super Happy Fun Fun, I tested mobile games across 100+ physical device models. I am comfortable with hands-on hardware testing and lab operations."

        <div class="question">"You don't have slot game experience. How will you ramp up?"</div>
        <div class="why">Address the obvious gap directly.</div>
        <div class="answer">
            "You are right, I have not tested slot games specifically. But I have ramped up on new domains quickly throughout my career — VA healthcare systems, robotics, HIPAA compliance. My approach is to immerse myself: play the games, read the documentation, ask questions, and learn the math and mechanics. I also have relevant experience from Linden Lab, where I evaluated user-created games for gambling compliance. I understand the regulatory mindset. The QA fundamentals transfer — what changes is the domain knowledge, and I pick that up fast."

        <div class="question">"How do you handle working with developers who may be resistant to QA?"</div>
        <div class="why">New QA in a team can create friction.</div>
        <div class="answer">
            "I earn trust by being helpful, not by being a gatekeeper. My job is to make their lives easier — catch issues before they become expensive, write bug reports that are actually useful, and never waste their time with noise. I am embedded with the team, not separate from it. I find that when developers see QA as a partner rather than a critic, resistance fades. At YouScience, I was the first QA person ever. Within months, developers were coming to me before releases because they trusted the process we built together."

        <div class="answer">
            "Gaming is where I started my career, and I have wanted to return. Bluberi's growth story is compelling — from 1,500 units to 12,000, quality over quantity approach, and the Austin studio is new. The chance to introduce QA to the Jackalope team, to help build something from the ground up, that is exactly the work I find most meaningful. I am not looking for a job where I maintain someone else's process. I want to create the foundation."

            "I want to be a QA leader who has helped Bluberi scale. Once the foundation is solid, I see myself mentoring other testers, contributing to QA strategy across studios, and continuing to grow with the company. I am not looking for a stepping stone — I am looking for a place to build something lasting."

    <div class="warning-box">
        <h3>Do Not...</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Oversell automation skills</strong> — Be honest that you are collaborative, not a developer. They know your background.</li>
            <li><strong>Apologize for not having slot experience</strong> — Acknowledge it once, then pivot to what you bring.</li>
            <li><strong>Talk too long</strong> — Keep answers to 1-2 minutes. Let them ask follow-ups.</li>
            <li><strong>Be negative about past employers</strong> — Even if true, it reflects poorly.</li>
            <li><strong>Forget to ask questions</strong> — Have 3-4 ready. It shows engagement.</li>
            <li><strong>Be robotic</strong> — They are a fun company. Let your personality show.</li>

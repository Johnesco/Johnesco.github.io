                       <p>Press Mute When You’re Sobbing on a Zoom Call

<p>Whether you’re a veteran of working from home, or if you are someone newly learning that muting your mic is important, welcome. Working from home is both rewarding and challenging. This is not an instruction manual on how best to work from home. It’s a guide to working from home and not losing an already delicate mind to existing or potential mental illness.</p>

<p>Some ideas I’d like to convey should ring true now and in the future. However, one aspect is unique to now.  I’m writing from the time of Coronavirus, also known as COVID-19. Workers have been divided into two groups, “essential” and “non-essential.” Those considered non-essential were sent home with hopes of slowing the spread of the disease. Those deemed essential, like doctors and grocery store clerks, were considered too vital to our way of life to stay home. One group unable to work, the other unable to stay home.</p>

<p>Then there’s us. A quasi third group. Those who have a job that is so tied to the glowy screen in front of them that it could be performed, in theory, from any location with a computer and internet. Theory was put to practice as many people - accustomed to commuting each day - suddenly learned the joy and perils of working in their jammies.</p>

<p>Working from home is not a new idea, but there had never been such a reason to push so many people to practice it. Some companies, historically, felt uncomfortable with workers staying home. With the arrival of COVID-19 they had a change of heart and now insist on it. Once and for all we will find out which meetings could have just been an email.</p>

<p>The pandemic has been hard on many people. If one is able to avoid the disease itself, they are still subject to staying in and staying isolated. Many never leave their home except for groceries or prescriptions. Some people thrive in this situation, but for others, it puts pressure on the mind and spirit. What about those who already have such a toll on their state of mind due to mental illness?</p>

Working a job, or doing anything, with mental illness can be its own challenge. Mental illnesses and disorders that can affect your work include depression, PTSD, panic disorder, agoraphobia, and borderline personality disorder - just to name a few. So what happens when those who suffer from one or more of these mental health issues have to stay at home every day for work?</p>

<p>There are advantages. If a moment strikes you when you can’t be your professional self, you can often step away and have that cup of tea and peace of mind. Going heads-down and focusing on your task is where you might thrive. However, working from home can still mean having dead-lines and going to live meetings. Needing help or coordination from distant workers can quickly tax your social resources.</p>

<p>There will be a great deal of communication through multiple methods ranging from group video calls to instant messages. Things can get out of control quickly if you don’t set limits. When you want to reach someone it may be unclear which method to use. "Should I email or call them?" you might find yourself pondering. This can frustrate you to the point of not taking action at all. Getting a handle on the lines of communication is vital.</p>

<p>Request to have as few modes of communication as possible. You might find yourself responding to text messages, reading emails, taking phone calls, or answering instant messages from WhatsApp, Slack, or more. It will certainly create a growing obsession towards monitoring notifications rather than actual work.</p>

<p>If a consensus can not be found, give your coworkers clear communication on how you want to be reached, and ask them what they prefer. Needing to check the notification on so many apps is a recipe for a panic attack and overwhelming yourself.</p>

<p>Let’s consider meetings. You’ve seen it by now - or you will - a Zoom meeting with people saying “hello hello, is this thing on?” It’s amazing that in a time we all have computers in our pocket, that it’s still hard to coordinate things like your own audio, video, and even lighting conditions. If you suffer panic attacks it's best not to be unknotting your earphones while the CEO is about to make a big presentation. Get ready early, check that you can be heard and can hear others. If another meeting is about to start, leave on time. Respect the start time of that new meeting. Overlapping meetings that never end are a sign that boundaries are not being observed. Boundaries are hard for most, but if you have a mental illness they can feel impossible to set.</p>

<p>On a similar note, let’s look at the start and end of work. Being on time is important. Wait, you just need to roll out of bed and turn on a computer? Great, but is it though?  You get there just in time to say the proverbial “here!” If you are not ready to work, you are falling behind. Extend this idea to the day itself. When is the day over? Did you start a little late so you feel obligated to work a little later? Do you have a time when other people can expect that you won’t get their message until the next business day? Does working-from-home turn into working-all-the-time?</p>

<p>Getting to work on time also means leaving work on time. Those who have had a reactive or abusive partner know that setting boundaries can escalate situations instead of repairing them. Telling your boss “I'd like to be offline after 6:30.” can result in the fear that you’ll just be told to close your computer and never return. But these are the boundaries one must set. Finding this work-life balance is doubly important for the mentally ill because we need to reserve time for ourselves for repair and growth.</p>

<p>Among all my reminders to you, remember to leave the house. In the time of COVID-19, this gets convoluted because “Stay home, stay safe!” is the phrase of the day. Having issues going outside can be a part of mental illness. In extreme cases, some people are afraid to go out the front door. With nearly everything being available for delivery, it's now possible to stay home for days, that is not a good recipe for mental health. When your day ends - and make sure it ends - get some fresh air and possibly some exercise.</p>

<p>Plan the rest of your day ahead of time. Look forward to it and go out and enjoy it. Day to day life is already hard with mental health issues. Don’t let working from home be another hardship. Breath deeply, take care of your mind and don’t let the mixture of home and work overwhelm you. Don't forget your most important job is to take care of yourself.</p>

                        <p>You've experienced it before, with anything from an app to a kitchen utensil. That feeling that says, "This is like an extension or augmentation of myself." Maybe you've felt the opposite and felt a tool was doing more harm than good in a daily task.</p>
 
<p>Human Centered Design likely played a role (or failed to) in any device, tool, or software that you use in daily life. Today’s managers and product owners create and follow processes and procedures to make sure daily operations happen smoothly. With an existing product, it’s easy to hone a set of behaviors that achieves good results. However, applying this to designing a new product can be more complex. How do you make sure a new product or service meets its user's needs? How can you make sure you're building something for the right audience?</p>
 
<p>One such methodology is Human Centered Design. It was pioneered by Bill Moggridge who was the cofounder of the design company named IDEO. They have created a website at www.designkit.org which teaches and advocates the use of Human Centered Design.</p>
 
<p>What exactly is it? It’s a set of activities, frameworks, and protocols that encourage empathy towards the intended user. Ideally creating a product that best serves the audience in mind. It's tempting to compare it to working methods such as Scrum or Agile. However, those are meant to maximize results being done by a team while Human Centered Design is focused on never losing sight of and staying connected to the audience for which you are creating a product or service.</p>

<p>How does it work? Human Centered Design takes many forms but I will focus on the methodologies described on www.designkit.org. The Field Guide to Human-Centered Design prefaces any distinct steps with sharing their seven mindsets: Empathy, Optimism, Iteration, Creative Confidence, Making, Embracing Ambiguity, and Learning from Failure. From the beginning it emphasizes that it is an organic process that is not meant to be a cookie-cutter solution to rigid problems. That being said, there are three phases that are described to help you guide your design and keep it human-centric: Inspiration, Ideation, and Implementation.</p>
 
<p>The Inspiration phase is where you not only define your audience, but also conduct interviews. As strongly as, "What are we building?" Human Centered Design makes you ask, "Who are we building this for?" It's a time to walk around in the shoes of your potential customers and ensure you understand their needs.</p>
 
<p>After gathering knowledge, you are ready for the Ideation phase. This knowledge needs to be analyzed and broken down into what can become concrete solutions. But first, you'll brainstorm and storyboard these ideas and see which have a real and supported possibility of working for your audience. After deeply researching the "who" and the "what" behind your product, you enter the Implementation phase. You'll start to build prototypes of things you want to make and a plan for how to build them, as well as how to define when you've succeeded. If these steps leave you stalling for what to do next, www.designkit.org has a number of methods for each of these phases to break any writer's block you may have. Some of these methods include "Conversation Starters" for the Inspiration phase, "Gut Check" for the Ideation Phase, and "Roadmap" for the Implementation Phase.</p>
 
<p>What's important to remember is that Human Centered Design is a set of tools and mindsets to steer you in the direction of designing for your audience. It places those who you will design for at the center of the process rather than a single creator in charge of all choices. Much like any framework, it's up to you to adhere to or ignore the guidelines it sets forth.</p>

<p>The next time you are using your favorite app, frustrated while searching in a store, or struggling with a new tool, you'll find that Human Centric Design can make a difference in your daily life.</p>

<p>I can see all my parts, if they place my eyes in just the right place. I can imagine what it's like to be put back together. However I just wait, unable are move until my pieces are reassembled so that I can get on with my life.</p>

<p>I'm not sure why the nightly disassembly started. I was asked to lay down and before I knew it I was taken down to my components. I assumed it was some kind of maintenance or cleaning. But after being taken down to my smallest pieces, I'd just sit there. It was hard to determine for how long with my internal clock being in pieces.</p>

<p>As they do it I feel less and less whole. When they put me back together I worry a screw or washer has been left out, but so far there are no parts are missing. My sqeaky foot continues to squeak leading me to believe that my nightly break down isn't restorative in nature.</p>

<p>I've sat here contemplating this and the sun has set. I can hear them approaching to remove bits of me until I lay as a pile of parts waiting to be assembled again. I can hear them coming with their tools.
